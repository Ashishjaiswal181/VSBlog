# VSBlog
It is a blog on the school I studied in.
The School name is Victoria School (in short VS), the blog has been made into a web page which is also reponsive to the size of the device.
The main aim to develop this page was to learn html, css and also I have great meories with the school which I wanted to express as a blog so why not that be on my own blog webiste.
